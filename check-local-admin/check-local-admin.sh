### ACTIVE DIRECTORY USER PERMISSIONS SCRIPT ###
### by Graham Pugh
### Props to Jeff Kelley, Graham Gilbert and various others for elements of script

### This script looks at the "Allow Administration By" field of the 
### `dsconfigad -show` command and checks each of the Active Directory users  
### with mobile accounts on the computer to check whether they should have
### local admin rights.  It amends each user's membership of the local 
### 'admin' group accordingly.
###
### This ensures that users retain admin rights when away from the bound network,
### but removes any users that are no longer eligible for admin rights once the 
### computer sees the network again.

### This script can be run as a LaunchDaemon to run when a user logs in, 
### to automatically check whether they have admin rights or not

sleep 15 # wait before executing to give network time to start
